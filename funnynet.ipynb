At the same street corner he passed a hooker standing there every day. He learned to brace himself as he approached her for what was almost certain to follow. “One hundred and fifty pounds!” she’d shout. “No! Five pounds!” He said from the side of His mouth, just to shut her up. This ritual between him and the hooker became a daily occurrence. She’d yell, “One hundred and Fifty pounds!” He’d yell back, “Five pounds!” One day, Camilla decided to accompany her ‘husband’. As the couple neared the hooker’s corner, Prince Charles realised she’d bark her £150 offer and Camilla would wonder what he’d really been doing on all his past outings. He figured he’d better have a good explanation for his Wife As they neared the hooker’s corner he became even more apprehensive than usual. Sure enough, there she stood. He tried to avoid eye contact as she watched the pair pass. Then, the hooker yelled: “See what you get for five pounds, you tight bastard!”......😂',\n",

Tomorrow, if you come early and place your order, we will be sure to save you this delicacy.'\\n\\nThe next morning, the cowboy returned, placed his order, and that evening was served the one and only special delicacy of the day.   After a few bites, inspecting his platter, he called to the waiter and said, 'These are delicious, but they are much, much smaller than the ones I saw you serve yesterday.'\\n\\nThe waiter shrugged his shoulders and replied, 'Si, Senor.

He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked 'Is the coming winter going to be cold?' \\n\\n'It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,' the weather man responded. \\n\\nSo the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood.

What was that?!'\\n\\nSo she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear...\\n\\n'You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.'\\n\\nShe responded to my puzzled look by saying, 'Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?'\\n\\nRealizing that nothing was going to happen that night, I went to sleep.\\n\\nThe very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her we'd just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said, 'Lets get a pair for each outfit.'\\n\\nWe went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.\\n\\nI think I threw her for a loop when I said, 'That's fine, honey.' She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.\\n\\nSmiling with excited anticipation, she finally said, 'I think this is all dear, let's go to the cashier.'\\n\\nI could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, 'No honey, I don't feel like it.'\\n\\nHer face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, 'WHAT?'\\n\\nI then said, 'Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.'\\n\\nAnd just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, 'Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?'\\n\\nApparently I'm not having sex tonight either..😂😂😄😃\",\n",
